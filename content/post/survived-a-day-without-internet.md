It’s very pleasing rainy weather here. However internet connection is
down which is not appealing for me. It’s time to scream at my [ISP](http://www.bsnl.co.in/) :)

How terrible it is without internet ? Still I managed to get going. If
I had had the internet, I would simply be roaming somewhere in
there. As of now all I need is Haskell documentation. Never mind; I
’ve downloaded an [off-line](http://www.haskell.org/ghc/docs/latest/) copy a couple of days back which now I find
it very handy.

I use my mobile to read whenever I don’t need a compiler to play with.
Also right now, I’m just going through The Haskell Library. The source
code of modules itself is a great resource that I got along with
haddock generated documentation.

Chrome doesn’t allow direct file access to SD card. Anyway I have got
a [server](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.xeustechnologies.android.kws&hl=en) application installed in my mobile. I just ran a local HTTP
Server.

That’s Awesome ! Felt good that there is no distraction. Anyway I
would go crazy if this continues. No matter whether I watch cats or do
something productive, I want my effin' internet connection back!
Period.
