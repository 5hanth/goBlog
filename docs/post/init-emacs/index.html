        <p>Yo! I&rsquo;m the kind of ones who prefer a true editor rather fancy
IDE&rsquo;s. I have been a VIm user for the past four years. Had tried Emacs
before; may be a couple of times I guess, apparently gave up for some
uncanny reasons and I thought it would make me acquire RIS (Recursive
Injury Syndrome). I always found myself lost in never ending religious
flame wars which took me no where from my dilemma of choosing one from
these two editors.</p>

<p>I started out with VIm first and sub-merged into awesomeness of VIm
all day which made me not to think of any other editor out of VIm
realm. But now it is the case that I can&rsquo;t accept myself anymore of me
ignoring something for this long without investing a considerable
amount of time and thought into it. It is just that in this context, I
can neither say Emacs is bad nor VIm is good. Rather I should take
emacs for dating long enough to that of one I did with VIm; only then
it would give me a sense of relative comparability; still it would be
a very subjective opinion.</p>

<p>I like Lisp dialects and Haskell family. Emacs is the selling point of
what can be practically possible with Lisp. So I thought if not for
the editor; I would taste a dialect of Lisp if I start using Emacs.</p>

<p>PS : Didn&rsquo;t I mention that here whole Chennai is lost in map due to
water logging caused by historically very heavy rainfall and all
telecommunication lines are shut down; taking off the entire city
offline for past 48 hours(still continuing). I was bored being offilne
and found Emacs to play with is the reason for this writing. oh yeah!
this monopolistic - politically backed telecos will never let
decentralized peer-peer communication systems to come in way of their
business. The day will come when every common man realizes
Electromagnetic spectrum is not the owning property for specific group
of monopolistics who play the License Raj game.</p>

<p>~ cheers..,</p>
